# Predicting Commuter Transportation Choice

### Background

This is an analysis on one of the classic dataset. 

Resident of the north suburbs of Sydnet, Australia can commute to downtown Sydney by car or trai. Their choice of transportation will be due, in part, to the time and cost of commuting by car and train. On the day of the Journey to Work Survey, Sydney commuters indicate their primary method of transportation and their best alternative method of transportation (car or train). For both the chosen and alternativemethods, 333 commuters provide time and cost estimates for all trip components by car, train, bus, walking and other modes of transportation


### Variable Description
* Cartime: Time of the commute by car (in minutes)
* carcost: Cost of the commute by car (in cents)
* traintime: Time of the commute by train (in minutes)
* traincost: Cost of the commute by train (in cents)
* Choice: Choice of transportationi mode (car or train)

### Questions?

Given the features of this dataset some questions we may want to ask.

* Do people prefer to travel by train or car? 
* How does travel time effect this prefence?
* How does price effect this prefence?
* If price of either mode of transport changes how will it effect there choice?


### Other factors

 Other than price and transport time what other factors may influence these choices

* Avaliablity and usage of other modes of transport
* Location of work and home.
* Distance from the mode of transport 
* Weather for each day
* Quality of transport - how regluar does it run, is it busy or not.

If we had data on these factors we could do a more sophisticated analysis
